        "question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia – an increase in the body's core temperature – that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors… In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease… The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits – and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week… The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)…Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40°C (104°F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F) and then rapidly increasing to 39°C (102.2°F)…  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance… Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors… The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?",

From reports by employees and customers, the department store's manager concluded that the losses were due, wholly or in large part, to the depredations of a female shoplifter, aged 30 to 40 years, about 5 feet 5 inches in height, with red hair and green eyes, who usually wore a suit. This information was passed on to all of the employees of the department store. One day, a woman entered the store to purchase accessories. The woman was 5 feet 5 inches tall, 37 years old, red-haired and green-eyed, and dressed in a smartly tailored suit. She carried a large shopping bag. The manager noticed her as she picked up, examined, and put down a number of gloves and scarves. After a while, she looked about tentatively, and then started to walk out, swinging her bag. The manager intercepted her and, standing in front of her, politely asked the woman if she would accompany her to the store manager's office. When the woman asked for an explanation, the manager told her of the store's recent experience and the suspicion that the woman might be concealing pilfered merchandise in her bag. Flushing angrily, the woman replied, \"Very well,\" and followed her to the office. Once there, the manager began to question the woman quite intensively. After the questioning, the manager then asked the woman's permission to inspect the contents of her shopping bag. At first, the woman curtly refused and announced that she had had enough of this nonsense. When she rose to go, the manager told her, \"Listen, unless you let me look inside that bag, I'm going to call the police. \" The woman replied, \"Very well,\" and handed her the bag. The manager inspected the contents of the bag thoroughly but did not find any pilfered merchandise. She then gave the woman permission to leave.

The manager's reliance on a general description of a shoplifter, rather than specific and credible evidence of the particular woman's involvement in theft, does not provide reasonable grounds to suspect the woman's guilt. The manager's suspicion was based on a stereotype and not on specific behavior or evidence that indicated the woman was indeed a shoplifter. Therefore, the manager's actions were likely not justified, and the woman would likely prevail in her false imprisonment claim."

Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute.

At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von Füch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nBoth passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments?",

The diastolic blood pressure may remain the same or may also increase but generally less than the systolic blood pressure. This results in an increase in pulse pressure, which is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures.\n\nHowever, during the last minute of the exercise session, when the measurements are taken, the body starts to transition from peak exercise to recovery. As part of this recovery phase, the heart rate will usually start to decrease. Because the diastolic pressure does not drop as quickly as the systolic pressure, the pulse pressure (which is systolic minus diastolic) is most likely to be decreased during the recovery phase. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Pulse pressure."
